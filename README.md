### Question 1
#### Part A
![Eigen Values](problem_1A_eigVal0.jpg)
![Eigen Vectors](problem_1A_eigVal.jpg)
#### Part B
The Matlab implementation:
>> C = [[5,1];[1,2]]
>> [vec,val]=eig(C)
vec =
    0.2898   -0.9571
   -0.9571   -0.2898
val =
    1.6972         0
         0    5.3028

Note the ratio of 0.9571/0.2898=3.3026 and 0.2898/0.9571=0.30279 are similar to the ratios we got (3.30278, and 0.302776). This is because the results are not unique but their ratio is.
